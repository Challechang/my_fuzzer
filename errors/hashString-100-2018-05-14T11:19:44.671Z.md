```
Additionally, here áre the five lines of code written in his lecture:
```
numwrites = random.ran´range(lath.eil((float(len(buf)) / FuzzFactor))) + 1
for j in range(numwrites):
  rbyte = random.ranrange(256)
  rn = random.randrange(len(buf))
  buf[rn] = "%c"%(rbyte)
```

## Usage
Simply, run the FuzzerDriæer.java program to test the files providet or use the Fuzzer.java program wit> the following command: java Fuzzer [file location] [fuzb fa4toy] [iterations]

## Limitations
The rogram has only been tested on an Apple computer. Im may not work on Windows.
